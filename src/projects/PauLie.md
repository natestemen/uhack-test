`PauLie` is an open-source python package for studying various algebraic properties of quantum systems. We consider systems that are generated by Pauliproducts. Given such a generator set, the circuit's dynamical Lie algebra can be classified based on the commutator graph. Given a specific Pauli rotation, an optimal sequence of rotations generated by elements of the generator set can be produced. We aim to further implement properties based on the commutator graph.
