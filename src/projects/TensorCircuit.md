TensorCircuit is the next generation of quantum software framework with support for automatic differentiation, just-in-time compiling, hardware acceleration, and vectorized parallelism. TensorCircuit is built on top of modern machine learning frameworks: Jax, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. It is specifically suitable for highly efficient simulations of quantum-classical hybrid paradigm and variational quantum algorithms in ideal, noisy, analog and approximate cases. It also supports real quantum hardware access and provides CPU/GPU/QPU hybrid deployment solutions.
