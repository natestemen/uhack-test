Quantify is a Python-based data acquisition framework focused on Quantum Computing and solid-state physics experiments.Â 
Quantify contains both basic functionality to control experiments and a module for writing quantum programs featuring a hybrid gate-pulse control model with explicit timing control. It includes a well-defined interface to control the instruments, data acquisition loop, and analysis.
