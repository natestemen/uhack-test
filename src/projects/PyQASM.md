PyQASM is a Python toolkit providing an OpenQASM 3 semantic analyzer and utilities for program analysis and compilation.

[OpenQASM](https://openqasm.com/)¬†is a powerful language for expressing hybrid quantum-classical programs, but it lacks a comprehensive tool supporting the full capabilities of the language. PyQASM addresses this by using the official [ANTLR grammar](https://openqasm.com/grammar/index.html) as a reference for OpenQASM 3‚Äôs language structure and by leveraging the [`openqasm3.parser`](https://github.com/openqasm/openqasm/blob/ast-py/v1.0.1/source/openqasm/openqasm3/parser.py) to interact with the official AST. On top of this foundation, it adds high-level utilities such as program _validation_ and _unrolling_.

In PyQASM, ‚Äúunrolling‚Äù (also known as program flattening¬†or¬†inlining) refers to the process of simplifying a quantum program by expanding custom gate definitions, and flattening complex language constructs such as subroutines, loops, and conditional statements into a linear sequence of basic operations. By converting the program into this simplified format, it becomes easier to perform subsequent transpilation or compilation steps before executing the program on a quantum device.
