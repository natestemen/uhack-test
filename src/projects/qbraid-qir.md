qBraid-QIR is a Python package for generating¬†[QIR](https://www.qir-alliance.org/)¬†(Quantum Intermediate Representation) programs from high-level quantum programming languages. It currently supports conversions for [Cirq](https://quantumai.google/cirq) and [OpenQASM 3](https://openqasm.com/). This project aims to make QIR representations accessible via the¬†[qBraid-SDK transpiler](https://docs.qbraid.com/sdk/user-guide/transpiler), and by doing so, open the door to language-specific conversions from any of the 10+ gate-based quantum program types [supported](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid?tab=readme-ov-file#transpiler)¬†by¬†`qbraid`.
