Python package for generating [QIR](https://www.qir-alliance.org/) (Quantum Intermediate Representation) programs from high-level quantum programming languages. Currently supports conversions for Cirq and OpenQASM 3. This project aims to make QIR representations accessible via the [qBraid-SDK transpiler](https://docs.qbraid.com/sdk/user-guide/transpiler), and by doing so, open the door to language-specific conversions from any and all high-level quantum languages [supported](https://docs.qbraid.com/sdk/user-guide/overview#supported-frontends) by qbraid. See QIR Alliance: [why do we need it?](https://www.qir-alliance.org/qir-book/concepts/why-do-we-need.html).

This project was conceived in collaboration with the [Quantum Open Source Foundation](https://qosf.org/).
