Rivet is a modular, high-performance transpilation toolkit for quantum circuits, allowing users to flexibly choose and control transpilation stacks (like Qiskit, Pytket, or BQSKit), optimize for hardware constraints, and drastically reduce transpilation time. It supports features like subcircuit stitching, qubit constraint handling, caching, and performance debuggingâ€”making it ideal for iterative and large-scale quantum workflows.
