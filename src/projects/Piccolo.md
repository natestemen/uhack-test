**Piccolo.jl**Â is a Julia package for quantum optimal control for state preparation, analog quantum computation, gate design, and more! It is developed under the _Harmoniqs_ ðŸŽ¶ organization. Under the hood, it solves a wide variety of control problems using directÂ **trajectory optimization**, which is a state-of-the-art approach from robotics ðŸ¤– with a number ofÂ **key advantages**, like:

- âœ… Flexible problem design
- âœ… Better global convergence
- âœ… State-of-the-art minimum time control
- âœ… Highly-efficient parallelization
