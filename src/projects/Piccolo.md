Piccolo.jlÂ is a Julia package for quantum optimal control for state preparation, analog quantum computation, gate design, and more! It is developed under the Harmoniqs ðŸŽ¶ organization. Under the hood, it solves a wide variety of control problems using directÂ trajectory optimization, which is a state-of-the-art approach from robotics ðŸ¤– with a number ofÂ key advantages, like:
âœ… Flexible problem design
âœ… Better global convergence
âœ… State-of-the-art minimum time control
âœ… Highly-efficient parallelization
