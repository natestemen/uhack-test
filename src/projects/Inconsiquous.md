Inconspiquous is a relatively young MLIR-based compiler for hybrid quantum-classical programs. Unlike quantum circuits, in a hybrid program the gates to run can be generated at runtime, as the result of arbitrary computation or mid-circuit measurement.
Utilising a novel representation of hybrid programs, we can write and optimize code for a range of quantum computing domains, including quantum error correction and measurement based quantum computing.
