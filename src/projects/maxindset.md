The Maximum Independent Set problem is a constraint-solving problem on graphs. Many industries use approximate algorithms to find approximate solutions to this problem, as it is key to all sorts of applied issues of scheduling, optimization, etc.

The Pasqal Maximum Independent Set library is a simple library designed to solve the Maximum Independent Set problem through quantum algorithms -- using either a quantum computer, if you have access to one, or a built-in quantum emulator.
