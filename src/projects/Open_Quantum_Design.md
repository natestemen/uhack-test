Open Quantum Design is a non-profit foundation supporting the development of full-stack, open-source quantum computers. OQD's current designs are based on laser-cooled trapped ion quantum computing hardware, including real-time control, backend and frontend software. We have open-sourced repos for classical emulators for analog and atomic representations of quantum programs, our core interfaces, cloud tools, and our compilation infrastructure.
