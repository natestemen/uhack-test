This project contains issues on two repositories:

1. [üê† Guppy](https://github.com/CQCL/guppylang): Guppy is a quantum programming language that is fully embedded into Python. It allows you to write high-level hybrid quantum programs with classical control flow and mid-circuit measurements using Pythonic syntax.
2. [ü´Ç HUGR](https://github.com/CQCL/hugr): The Hierarchical Unified Graph Representation (HUGR, pronounced _hugger_) is a common representation for hybrid quantum circuits and operations, used at the backbone of üê† Guppy.

The project is focused on providing a fast and extensible framework for optimizing the next generation of quantum programs, that mix quantum circuits with classical control flow in the same package.
