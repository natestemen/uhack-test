This Symbolics project serves two purposes:
- QuantumSymbolics.jl provides for algebraic manipulation of mathematical expressions related to your quantum models. Particularly helpful when having to automatically generate or simplify expressions of significant complexity.
- QuantumSymbolics.jl contains an assortment of "expression translators" that can turn a symbolic expression into a numerical one in a variety of formalisms, e.g. state vectors, tensor networks, stabilizer states, Gaussian quantum states, etc.
