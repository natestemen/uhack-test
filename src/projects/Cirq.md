Cirq provides useful abstractions for dealing with today’s [noisy intermediate-scale quantum](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00862) (NISQ) computers, where the details of quantum hardware are vital to achieving state-of-the-art results. Some of its features include:
*  Flexible gate definitions and custom gates
*  Parameterized circuits with symbolic variables
*  Circuit transformation, compilation and optimization
*  Hardware device modeling
*  Noise modeling
*  Multiple built-in quantum circuit simulators
*  Integration with [qsim](https://github.com/quantumlib/qsim) for high-performance simulation
*  Interoperability with [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and [SciPy](https://scipy.org)
*  Cross-platform compatibility
