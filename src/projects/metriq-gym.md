**metriq-gym** is an open-source project created to make writing and running quantum benchmarks easier than ever. If you are familiar with MLPerf for AI, think of metriq-gym as the equivalent for quantum, enabling standardized benchmarking across different quantum devices and providers.

Written in Python, metriq-gym is powered by the qBraid SDK, allowing users to run benchmarks seamlessly on platforms like AWS Braket, IBM Quantum, Azure Quantum, and more.

We're also building a pipeline (still work in progress 🚧) where metriq-gym results will be submitted and visualized on metriq.info, making it easier for the quantum community to track and compare quantum benchmarks over time.

Started in November 2024 by the Metriq team at Unitary Foundation, metriq-gym is still in its early days—meaning there’s plenty of room to contribute. Don't let its youth fool you: we take code quality seriously, and we want to maintain a clean and well-structured codebase.
