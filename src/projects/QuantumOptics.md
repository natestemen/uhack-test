QuantumOptics.jl is a numerical framework written in Julia that makes it easy to simulate various kinds of quantum systems. It is inspired by the Quantum Optics Toolbox for MATLAB and the Python framework QuTiP. More information, documentation and examples can be found on our website http://qojulia.org.
