[Qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit) is a popular SDK to build, transpile, execute, and visualize quantum circuits, as well as It contains the building blocks for creating and working with quantum operators, and primitive functions (Sampler and Estimator). The transpiler supports optimizing quantum circuits. It also has quantum information toolbox for creating advanced operators.
