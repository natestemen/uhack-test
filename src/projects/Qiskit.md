The name [Qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit) is a general term referring to a collection of software from IBM Quantum for executing programs on quantum computers. Most notably among these software tools is the open-source Qiskit SDK.

[Qiskit SDK](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit) is an open-source Software Development Kit for building, optimizing, and running quantum circuits. It includes tools for circuit composition, visualization, and execution, as well as support for quantum operators and primitives like Sampler and Estimator. The transpiler enables circuit optimization, and the quantum information toolbox provides advanced operator support. Qiskit‚Äôs lean libraries and streamlined workflow help develop utility-scale, domain-specific solutions efficiently.

In addition to the SDK, other Qiskit tools participated in unitaryHACK are:

- [Aer](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aer/): A high performance simulator for quantum circuits that includes noise models.
- [Qiskit AI Transpiler](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-transpiler): A package to run AI and heuristic Qiskit transpiler passes on local and cloud environments.
- [rustworkx](https://github.com/Qiskit/rustworkx): A high performance Python graph library implemented in Rust. Used internally in several quantum computing libraries such as Qiskit and Pennylane.
- [Qiskit documentation](https://github.com/Qiskit/documentation): The documentation content home for [quantum.cloud.ibm.com](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs) and [docs.quantum.ibm.com](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com) (excluding API references, they are in the code itself as docstrings).
