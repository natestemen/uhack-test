AutoQASM provides a Pythonic developer experience for writing quantum programs. The name AutoQASM is derived from the name of the [AutoGraph module of TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/autograph). AutoQASM uses AutoGraph to construct quantum assembly (QASM) programs rather than TensorFlow graphs.

AutoQASM provides a natural interface for expressing quantum programs with mid-circuit measurements and classical control flow using native Python language features. It allows the construction of modular programs consisting of common programming constructs such as loops and subroutines. This enables a more imperative programming style than constructing programs via a series of function calls on a circuit object.

Although it is still a work in progress, the intent is that AutoQASM will support any quantum programming paradigm which falls into the [OpenQASM 3.0](https://openqasm.com/) language scope. AutoQASM supports serializing quantum programs to OpenQASM, which allows the programs to interoperate with any library or service that supports OpenQASM programs, such as Amazon Braket.
