At its core HierarQcal is a tool to generate compute graphs. It leverages a hierarchical representation to enable both user and machine to design these graphs in a modular and hierarchical way. This can be used to generate complex quantum circuit architectures, which is particularly useful for Neural Architecture Search (NAS), where an algorithm can determine the most efficient circuit architecture for a specific task and hardware. The package is open-source and framework-agnostic, it includes tutorials for Qiskit, PennyLane, and Cirq. HierarQcal offers an approach to explore and optimize quantum circuit architectures.
