Piccolo.jl is a meta-package for quantum optimal control using the Pade Integrator COllocation (PICO) method.

For documentation please see the individual packages.

## JuliaCon 2023 Talk

To see an overview of the PICO method and a demo of how to use this package, check out our recorded talk at JuliaCon 2023 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBdck6UX0Tc).

## Direct Collocation for Quantum Optimal Control

To see a detailed description of the PICO method, check out our paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03261). It won 2nd best paper in the QTEM category at IEEE QCE 2023!
