**OpenQAOA** is a python library that allows implementing the Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm on a variety of backends. Effectively, the package allows to solve optimisation problems using quantum computers and simulators.

Key features of the project include:

- **Build advanced QAOAs.** Create complex QAOAs by specifying custom parametrisation, mixer hamiltonians, classical optimisers, error mitigation techniques and execute the algorithm on either simulators or QPUs.
- **Problem classes.** Explore and create a wide range of problems that can be tackled by QAOA.
- **Recursive QAOA.** Run RQAOA with fully customisable schedules on simulators and QPUs alike.
- **QPU access.** Built in access for IBM Quantum, Rigetti QCS, Amazon Braket and Azure Quantum.
