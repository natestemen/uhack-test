This package is a quantum circuit simulator written in the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/), meant to be compatible with the [Amazon Braket SDK](https://github.com/amazon-braket/amazon-braket-sdk-python). It can simulate gate-based quantum circuits using both state vectors and density matrices (when noise is present).

[Amazon Braket](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/) is a fully managed quantum computing service designed to help speed up scientific research and software development for quantum computing.
