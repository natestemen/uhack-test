The Berkeley Quantum Synthesis Toolkit (BQSKit) [bis ‚Ä¢ kit] is a powerful and portable quantum compiler framework. It can be used with ease to compile quantum programs to efficient physical circuits for any QPU. BQSKit achieves its superior portability by utilizing a novel quantum circuit intermediate representation designed to facilitate numerical instantiation. On top of this IR, we built an algorithm framework and compiler infrastructure to efficiently accomplish any quantum compilation goal.
