Back in the mists of time, [Quantum Blur](https://github.com/qiskit-community/QuantumBlur) was used as the basis of quantum hackathon projects, allowing people to experiment with creating game levels and produce image effects. It then went on to be a tool used by professional artists, such as [Roman Lipski](https://www.romanlipski.com/).

This, along with other projects such as [QPIXL](https://github.com/HeidelbergQuantum/ParallelQPIXL), [QC-PAINT](https://qc-paint.quantumland.art/) show that quantum dynamics can be useful for art. So let's find some new directions!
